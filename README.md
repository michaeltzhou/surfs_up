# surfs_up

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to use Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to query June and December temperature in Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round
## Results
June has a mean temp of 74.9 and an IQR that spans 73-77. December has a mean temp of 71 and an IQR that spans 69-74. Thus, the temperatures of December are relatively comparable to the temperatures in July and is an indicator that, from a tempature perspective, a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
